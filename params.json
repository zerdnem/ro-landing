This is the main Ragnarok Online file and you can download it [HERE](https://www.nickyzai.com/?p=kro)\r\n* Next is to download our client. These are files that we need inorder to connect to the server. [LINK HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9CN6U7o6wroQ1RZVURwX1lMTDA/view?usp=sharing), [ANOTHER LINK](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zrx07g2p7ddl5gs/client.7z?dl=0)\r\n* After download, just click the installer **Full_kRO_Renewal_20150601_.exe** then install it.\r\n* Extract **client.7z** then copy the files inside it to the main **RO** folder except for the System folder.\r\n* Then copy the files inside the System folder to the main **RO**/**System** folder.\r\n* Now click **2013-08-07aRagexe_patched.exe** to run the game but first you must register a new account. Read the FAQ for more info.\r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\n\r\nHow to register?\r\n- Visit our control panel [HERE](http://128.199.135.168/). This is where you manage your account and whatnot.\r\n\r\nHow to update the client?\r\n- Run **rsu-kro-rag-lite.exe** and **rsu-kro-renewal-lite.exe** inside the main RO folder. Just don't click start after the update.\r\n\r\nHow to change resolution, disable sound, etc.?\r\n- Just run **opensetup.exe**.\r\n\r\nWhat RO emulator are you using?\r\n- I'm using [rAthena](https://github.com/rathena/rathena) instead of [Hercules](https://github.com/HerculesWS/Hercules). Here is a good [discussion](http://herc.ws/board/topic/2248-hercules-vs-rathena/) on which is a better emulator.\r\n\r\nWhat is the exp and drop rates?\r\n- You can type @rates ingame to see the rates.\r\n\r\nWhat are other commands that I can use ingame?\r\n- You can use commands like @save @go @autoloot @storage @rates @check @identify.\r\n\r\nWow, your FAQ suck!\r\n- Just make a pull request then change things that you don't want to see.\r\n\r\nThat's it, glhf!\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
