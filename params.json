This is where you manage your account and whatnot.\r\n\r\nHow to update the client?\r\n- Run **rsu-kro-rag-lite.exe** and **rsu-kro-renewal-lite.exe** inside the main RO folder. Just don't click start after the update.\r\n\r\nHow to change resolution, disable sound, etc.?\r\n- Just run **opensetup.exe**.\r\n\r\nCan I use multiple clients/windows?\r\n- Yes\r\n\r\nWhat RO emulator are you using?\r\n- I'm using [rAthena](https://github.com/rathena/rathena) instead of [Hercules](https://github.com/HerculesWS/Hercules). Here is a good [discussion](http://herc.ws/board/topic/2248-hercules-vs-rathena/) on which is a better emulator.\r\n\r\nIs this pre renewal or renewal?\r\n- [Renewal](http://irowiki.org/wiki/Renewal)\r\n\r\nWhat are the exp and drop rates?\r\n- You can type `@rates` ingame to see the rates.\r\n\r\nWhat are other commands that I can use ingame?\r\n- You can use commands like `@save` `@go` `@autoloot` `@storage` `@rates` `@check` `@identify`.\r\n\r\nWhat vps are you using or where did you host the emulator?\r\n- At digitalocean, here is a [screenshot](https://u.teknik.io/heH7Dx.png).\r\n\r\nWow, your FAQ suck!\r\n- Just make a pull request then change things that you don't want to see.\r\n\r\n###That's it, glhf!\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
